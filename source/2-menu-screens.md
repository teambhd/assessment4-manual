Once the game has finished loading, the first screen you will see is the main menu, as pictured above.

Clicking on the **Challenge Mode** button will launch the single-player game, in which the objective is to gain as many points as possible before a crash occurs. 

The **Versus Mode** button will start the multi-player experience, in which the first player to 3000 points will be victorious.

The **Help** button will open this user manual.

Finally, clicking **Quit** will close down the game.
