## Flights

Each flight is shown by a plane icon on the game screens (next to the red numbers in the image above), with the next waypoint on its flight-plan, current altitude and current speed shown on its right-hand side.

The currently selected flight is surrounded by a circle (flight 3 is selected in the above image) and can be commanded to turn left and right and to increase and decrease its altitude and speed using the buttons detailed in the Controls section of this manual. In normal flight conditions the minimum altitude for flights is 1000ft, the maximum altitude is 5000ft and the speed is always within the range of 200â€“400mph. Lines showing the flight-plan of the current flight are also shown - you can see in the image above that flight 3 is scheduled to pass waypoint H and to leave the airspace via EXP3.

It is possible to cycle between flights using the *Next Flight* and *Previous Flight* buttons.

## Waypoints

As touched on above, the airspace is populated by eight waypoints, which are shown as grey circles containing their associated letter. The main way in which points are gained is by piloting each flight through the waypoints on its flight-plan, with up to 100 points available for each waypoint visited, depending on how precisely the waypoint is overflown. 50 points are deducted if a flight leaves the airspace without having completed its assigned route.

## Take-Off and Landing

The two airports, known by their three-letter codes DHB and BHD, are shown as numbers 6 and 7 in the image above. New flights will appear on the ends of the airport runways, and can be commanded to take-off using the *Airport* key. Flight 4 in the image above is waiting to be told to take-off.

Flights can land at an airport if they are lined-up over the runway, and are already flying at their minimum altitude (1000ft) and speed (200mph). The words "Ready to land" will appear below the flight's airspeed when this is the case. Flights can land from either direction (i.e. from both the North and the South for BHD and from both the East and the West for DHB) and landing is also initiated by the *Airport* key. Some flights are scheduled, by their flight-plan, to land at an airport but all flights are capable of landing if instructed to by the player. Pressing the *Airport* key while landing is in progress will abort the landing.

## Timer and Scores

Scores are shown in the top-left corner of the screen, as indicated by the number 8 on the image above. The time elapsed since the beginning of the game is shown on the top-right (next to number 9 on the image) of the screen. Every 15 seconds, points will be awarded and the rate at which new flights appear will be increased slightly.

## Separation Rules

As in real life, in our game there are minimum distances (known as separation rules) that an air-traffic controller must leave between flights. If two flights become too close an orange line will be drawn between them (see flights 2 and 3 in the image above) and, in the worst-case scenario, a collision may occur if the flights become closer still. In Challenge Mode, the game will end once a collision occurs. The lower the difficulty level selected at the beginning of the game, the closer two planes are allowed to come before a crash is deemed to have occurred.
