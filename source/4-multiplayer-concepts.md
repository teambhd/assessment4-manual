# Multiplayer Concepts

## Aim of the Game

In Versus Mode, the first player to reach 3000 points will be declared the winner. Unlike in Challenge Mode, a crash between two flights does not end the game, but there will be a severe penalty of 500 points applied to the owner of each of the affected flights. If both flights are owned by the same player, that player will lose 1000 points. Otherwise, points are awarded for passing waypoints in the same way as the single-player game.

## Controls

Each player has their own flights (colour-coded either red or blue), and their own full set of keyboard controls, as detailed in the Controls section of this manual. Generally, red player is the player who sits on the left-hand side of the keyboard, while blue player sits on the right. Each player has their own selected flight, indicated by a colour-coded circle.

## Handover

It is possible for either player to handover control of a flight to the other, in a purely unilateral manner, by pressing their own *Handover* key. Although handover is instant, there is a cooling-down period after each handover, shown by a bar on the bottom-right of the screen during which time the affected player cannot give up any additional flights.
